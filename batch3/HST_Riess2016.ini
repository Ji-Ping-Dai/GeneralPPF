#angconversion converts inverse of the angular diameter distance at z = zeff to H0
#for the fiducial cosmology (omega_k = 0, omega_lambda = 0.7, w = -1)
#likelihood is in terms of inverse of the angular diameter distance, so includes the tiny cosmological 
#dependence of the measurement (primarily on w) correctly.
